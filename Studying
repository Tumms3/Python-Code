#Studying Practice
#This code helps you detemrine if you're studying enough or if you aren't
#Shows the current time
import time
#Pre-defining a map for the class
classHrs = {"inhours1":0, "inhours2":0, "inhours3":0}

#Asks user for the number of hours spent on the first class
inhours=int(input("How many hours a week should you spend on your first class?:") )

#Asks user for the number of hours spent on the second class
inhours2=int(input("How many hours a week should you spend on your second class?:") )

#Asks user for the number of hours spent on the third class
inhours3=int(input("How many hours a week should you spend on your third class?:") )

#Then asks the user how much plan to study each week
inweek=int(input("How many hours a week do you plan to study?:") )

#Asks user how often they are actually studying each week
trueweek=int(input("How many hours are you actually studying?:") )

#Code then adds up all the hours and divides by numbers of days that the user input on inweek
sum = inhours+inhours2+inhours3
if sum < trueweek:
    print("You are probably studying enough") 
elif sum > trueweek:
    print("You need to study more")
